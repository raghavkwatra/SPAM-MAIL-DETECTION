# SPAM-MAIL-DETECTION
Spam mail detection is a common and essential task in email management, involving the classification of emails into spam and non-spam categories. A basic spam detection system can be built using Python with libraries such as scikit-learn for machine learning and NLTK for natural language processing. Hereâ€™s how you can create a simple spam mail detection project:

# Project Outline
Data Collection:

Use a labeled dataset of emails, where each email is marked as spam or non-spam (ham). The popular "SMS Spam Collection" dataset can be used for simplicity.


Data Preprocessing:

Clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
Tokenize and transform text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).


Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Train a machine learning model, such as a Naive Bayes classifier, on the training data.


Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


Prediction:

Test the model with new emails to predict whether they are spam or not.
